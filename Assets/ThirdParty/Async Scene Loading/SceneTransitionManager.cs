/*
    This class is designed to manage all scene transitions in an asynchronous way.
    It nicely wraps all of the complexity and accessed via the singleton instance SceneTransitionManager.Instance
    
    This class belongs on a canvas with an Image child. 
    In the provided example I used a black texture, however feel free to substitute whatever you want.
    This texture's alpha is then faded up and down to ease UX of transitions.
    Async loading should start once the texture fades into site, follow that the desired level will load.
    The screen will remain black until loading is finished at which point the texutre will fade out.
    
    The methods for fading the screen to or from black have been left public if, for some reason, 
    you want to fade the screen without changing the level.
    
    There is a loading bar and flashing loading text included as well, this is optional.
    If you do not wish to use these then remove the all the code concerning loadingText and loadingSlider.
    To turn these off and on call the ScreenFade.EnableLoadingUI() method, 
    passing it a boolean for whether you want them on (true) or off (false).
